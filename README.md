# hadome

**A coding agent with the brakes on.**

It drives the ChatGPT tab you already have open, from inside VSCodium or VS Code.
No API key, no second subscription — the extension reaches the tab over a local
WebSocket, so the plan you already pay for is the one it uses.

*hadome* (歯止め) is Japanese for the chock you put under a wheel. This project is
mostly that: an agent that runs on your machine, and the brakes that keep it there.

## What it does

You type a request in a side panel. ChatGPT answers with tool calls. The extension runs
them on your machine, sends the results back, and repeats until the work is done.

**28 tools**: reading and editing files, running commands (long ones move to the
background and you can read their output later), searching the codebase, globbing, web
search and fetch, driving a browser, a to-do list, git worktrees, and reading your rules
and skills.

**It picks up the setup you already have.**

- `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` — your global agent rules go into the first message, so you do
  not restate them every time
- `~/.agents/skills` — the list goes with them; type `/` in the input box to pick one,
  `@` to name a file, **↑** to bring back something you typed before
- `~/.claude.json` — MCP servers you already run show up as tools
- `~/.claude/output-styles/` — response styles, by name

**It is wired into the editor, not bolted beside it.** From the editor: explain, fix or
improve the selected code; add a selection to the chat. From the terminal: add its
output to the chat, or ask why a command failed. From a reply: accept or reject each
suggested change one block at a time, jump between code blocks, or open one in the
editor area.

**Conversations are yours to keep.** Start a new one, start one as a named role with its
own tool set, reopen a saved one, export it, import it back, or schedule a prompt to run
later. The bridge can also write its own rules into a ChatGPT project's instructions for
you.

**It can delegate.** Up to four sub-agents run at once (`subAgents`, default 2), each in
its own small ChatGPT window, so a search and a build can happen side by side without blocking
the conversation. Finished sub-agent conversations are archived in ChatGPT by default, so
your history stays clean (`subAgentCleanup`).

**Pick the model and thinking effort without leaving the editor.** The mode button under the
input box lists the models your ChatGPT plan actually offers — read from ChatGPT, so a Go and a
Business account see different lists — plus a thinking-effort slider. Sub-agents get their own
choice on the settings page (the gear at the top of the panel), so the main agent can think hard
while sub-agents that only read files answer on Instant.

  <img src="media/models-en.png" width="420"

  <sub>*Main agent in the mode menu, sub-agents on the settings page.*</sub>
</p>

**It can use a browser** — not yours. It runs a separate profile, and that is enforced
in code: before touching a debugging port it reads which process holds it and refuses
unless that process is on the isolated profile. Pages open as background tabs, and stay
open until the work is done.

       alt="The panel showing what browser_read returned: an accessibility tree with a text box, a dropdown and its options, a checked checkbox and a button — then browser_set putting a value into the dropdown.">
  <br>
  <sub>*It reads the accessibility tree, not a screenshot — so a dropdown is a dropdown, and what is selected is visible.*</sub>
</p>


**Permission is layered, not a single switch.** Four modes (`ask` / `edit` / `plan` /
`never`), your own named modes with their own tool sets, an allowlist and a denylist for
commands, separate read and write permission for folders outside the workspace,
per-server MCP approval, per-origin browser approval — and everything you grant with
"always allow" can be taken back one item at a time. See [Safety](#safety).

  <img src="media/brakes-en.png" width="420"
       alt="The panel showing three refused tool calls — a credential file, a protected path, a file outside the workspace — and a command waiting for permission.">
  <br>
  <sub>*Three refusals and one question, in a single turn.*</sub>
</p>


**It can run your own checks.** Put a `.chatgpt-bridge/hooks.json` in the workspace and
your commands run before and after each tool call.

## Requirements

- **Editor** — VSCodium or VS Code 1.96+
- **Node** — 20 or newer
- **Browser** — A Chromium-based browser with a ChatGPT session you are signed in to

## Install

Two pieces have to be installed: the editor extension and the browser extension. They
find each other over `ws://127.0.0.1:8765`.

1. Download `hadome-<version>.vsix` and `hadome-chrome-<version>.zip`
   from [Releases](../../releases).
2. In the editor: **Extensions → … → Install from VSIX…** and pick the `.vsix`.
3. Unzip the browser package somewhere permanent.
4. In the browser: open `chrome://extensions`, turn on **Developer mode**, choose
   **Load unpacked**, and select the unzipped folder.
5. Open a ChatGPT tab and sign in.
6. In the editor, open the **ChatGPT Bridge** panel. It should say the tab is connected.


## Safety

The agent runs on your machine, so the interesting part of this project is what it is
**not** allowed to do.

- **Commands are not run through a shell.** They go through `execFile`, so `;` `|` `>`
  cannot be used to chain past the allowlist.
- **Commands not on the allowlist stop and ask you.** "Always allow" remembers the
  program, never the whole command line.
- **Files outside the workspace stop and ask you**, with reading and writing tracked
  separately.
- **Protected paths are never writable** — `.git/`, `.vscode/settings.json`,
  `~/.claude.json` and similar — not by settings, not by an approval.
- **Secrets are not sent.** Files that look like credentials are withheld, and they are
  also hidden from search results, because their existence is itself a hint.
- **Web pages need provenance.** The agent can only open a URL you pasted, or one it
  reached from a page you already approved.
- **Browser tools touch an isolated profile only**, never the browser you use, and they
  refuse to open the site ChatGPT itself is running on.
- **MCP tools and MCP resources both stop and ask you**, per server.
- Every "always allow" you grant can be taken back from the command palette.

Every rule above is enforced in `src/tools.js`, not by convention.

## What is not in this repository

This repository carries what you need to build and run the extension. The test suite,
the measurement tools and the development notes are not published.

That means **you cannot re-run the checks that hold the rules above in place.** They
exist — each new guardrail is added together with a deliberate break, to prove the check
fails when the guardrail is removed — but they are not part of this distribution. What you can do instead is read `src/tools.js`: every gate above is in
there, and the code is the whole of it.

Source comments are removed when this tree is built, so the code here says what it does
but not why.

## Building it yourself

```bash
npm install
npm run build            # bundle the panel (webview/src → webview/dist)
npm run package          # → hadome-<version>.vsix
npm run package:chrome   # → hadome-chrome-<version>.zip
```

`npm run package` runs `vsce package` with `--allow-missing-repository`,
`--skip-license` and `--no-rewrite-relative-links`. It rebuilds the panel first, so a
stale bundle never ends up in the `.vsix`.

## How it is built

```
editor ─ panel (webview/) ─ extension.js ─ src/agent.js ─ src/bridge.js
                                  │                          ║ WebSocket
                                  ├ src/protocol.js          ║
                                  ├ src/tools.js         chrome-extension/ ─ chatgpt.com
                                  ├ src/browser.js
                                  └ src/mcp.js
```

- `src/protocol.js` — builds the first message and parses tool calls out of the reply
- `src/tools.js` — the tools themselves, and every gate described above
- `src/browser.js` — drives an isolated browser over the DevTools protocol
- `src/mcp.js` — an MCP client, so servers you already run show up as tools
